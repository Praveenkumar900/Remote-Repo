This section describes the assumptions, open issues, and closed issues related to the development of the Salesforce application. Assumptions outline the underlying conditions and expectations that influence the design and implementation of the system. Open issues represent outstanding tasks or problems that require resolution, while closed issues detail those that have been successfully addressed.

Assumption 1: The development of the Salesforce application will be carried out by developers in a Development Sandbox environment.
Assumption 2: Changes made to the application will be deployed to the QA Environment at the end of each sprint for testing.
Assumption 3: QA testers will have all the necessary permissions to access the QA Environment and perform thorough testing.
Assumption 4: Changes will only be deployed to the UAT (User Acceptance Testing) environment after successful completion of QA testing.
Assumption 5: Once the application passes UAT testing, it will be deployed to the Production environment.


Open Issues
This section provides an overview of the open issues that have been identified during the development and testing phases of the project. Each issue is categorized based on its priority, environment, and assigned developer.

Issue Tracking:

To effectively manage and track issues, we will utilize a dedicated defect tracking tool (e.g., Jira, Bugzilla). This tool will allow us to assign issues to specific developers, track their progress, and monitor resolution times.

Issue Categories:

Issues will be categorized based on their severity and impact on the system:

Blocker: Issues that prevent the system from functioning as intended or that have a major impact on user experience.
Critical: Issues that significantly affect the system's functionality but do not completely prevent it from working.
Minor: Issues that have a limited impact on the system's functionality or user experience.
Trivial: Issues that are primarily cosmetic or have minimal impact on the system.
Issue Resolution:

Once an issue is identified, it will be assigned to a developer responsible for resolving it. The developer will investigate the issue, determine the root cause, and implement a solution.

Issue Tracking and Monitoring:

Throughout the development and testing process, we will continuously monitor the status of open issues. This includes tracking the resolution time, ensuring that issues are addressed in a timely manner, and updating the issue status as needed.

Issue Resolution Details:

For each resolved issue, we will document the specific changes made to the code or configuration to address the problem. This information will be included in the issue's resolution details.

Impact Analysis:

When resolving issues, we will assess their potential impact on the system or users. This will help us prioritize issues and ensure that critical issues are addressed promptly.

By following this structured approach to issue management, we aim to identify and resolve issues efficiently, ensuring the quality and reliability of the final product.
