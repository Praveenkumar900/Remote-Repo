Testing Process
Overview
This section outlines the testing process for our project, aligning with the Agile methodology and specifically using the Kanban board to track User Stories through their various stages.

Testing Phases
User Story Movement:

In Progress: The development team is actively working on the User Story.
QA: Once development is complete, the User Story is moved to QA for testing.
QA Completed: Testing is finished, and the User Story is ready for UAT.
UAT: The User Story is deployed to the UAT environment for user acceptance testing.
UAT Completed: UAT is successful, and the User Story is ready for production.
Done: The User Story has been deployed to production.
Testing Activities:

Test Case Creation:

Scenario Development: Analyze the User Story's requirements to identify potential test scenarios.
Test Case Writing: Create detailed test cases in an Excel document, covering both positive and negative scenarios.
Test Case Review: Submit test cases for review by relevant stakeholders.
Test Case Execution:

Execution: Execute test cases in the QA sandbox.
Defect Logging: Report failed test cases as defects in Jira, assigning them to the development team.
Evidence Collection: Capture screenshots as evidence for passed test cases and upload them to Jira.
Issue Tracking:

Monitoring: Track the status of defects and retest fixed issues.
Closure: Move issues to "Done" when they are resolved and retested successfully.
Sprint Cycle and Deployment
Sprint Duration: Our project follows a 2-week sprint cycle.
Deployment: At the end of each sprint, User Stories that have passed UAT testing are deployed to production. This marks the completion of the sprint and the start of a new one.
