Creating Recurring Donations
Recurring donations are a valuable tool for nonprofit organizations as they provide a steady stream of income. In Salesforce, creating a recurring donation requires a few essential steps.

Prerequisites:

Contact Record: This represents the donor who will be making the recurring donation.
Account Record: This is the organization or company associated with the donor.
Steps:

Navigate to the Recurring Donations Object:

Locate and access the "Recurring Donations" object within your Salesforce instance. This may be found under the "App Launcher" or within a custom app.
Create a New Recurring Donation:

Click the "New" button to create a new recurring donation record.
Fill in the required fields:
Donor Type: Select "Account" as all recurring donations should be associated with an account.
Account: Choose the account associated with the donor.
Contact: Select the contact record representing the donor.
Amount: Enter the amount of each recurring donation.
Recurring Type: Choose either "Open" for an indefinite duration or "Fixed" to specify a number of planned installments.
Recurring Period: Select the frequency of donations (e.g., monthly, quarterly). If you choose "Monthly," you can further customize the day of the month.
Payment Method: Indicate the preferred payment method (e.g., payroll deduction, partner draw).
Save the Recurring Donation:

Once you've completed the required fields, click the "Save" button to create the recurring donation record.
Understanding Recurring Donation Details:

Opportunities: Salesforce will automatically create a series of opportunities associated with the recurring donation. These opportunities represent each individual installment.
Status: The status of the recurring donation can be "Active," "Lapsed," "Closed," or "Paused."
Upcoming Installments: The record will display information about the next scheduled donation and any future installments.
By following these steps, you can effectively create recurring donations in Salesforce and manage your organization's ongoing revenue streams.
